/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/
 *
 * You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words,
 * that are all of the same length.
 *
 * Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of
 * each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
 *
 * For example, given:
 *
 * s: "barfoothefoobarman"
 * words: ["foo", "bar"]
 *
 * You should return the indices: [0,9].
 * (order does not matter).
